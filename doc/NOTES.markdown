## Key message

We're still branding our identity so Woldumar's logo is important. Who and what is Woldumar is also very important. We're all about the Great Outdoors so a peaceful and natural ambiance is very fitting. Visitor comments include: "It's like being in Northern Michigan. I can't believe it's so close to downtown Lansing". Woldumar has one of the most diverse ecosystems in the region. We are all about education in everything we do so our website should reflect that. Our education programs are curriculum specific and provide teachers a very valuable activity for their students. Woldumar is not affiliated with Delta Township, Eaton County or the City of Lansing and so does not use tax dollars to fund its operation. We are one of the few nature centers left in the nation that is self-funded. It is only because of modest program fees and the generosity of our community that Woldumar exists today. Oour website should reflect that, too.

# Site design

## Overall tone

The overall tone of the website should be family-friendly with very natural earth tones. It should be very easy to use and should be very easy to search. It should be representative of Woldumar which was orignially an old dairy farm donated by Gladys Olds Anderson daughter of the automotive pioneer Ransom E. Olds. Maybe the website could include a children's section that might include Woldumar's coloring book?

Earthy, natural, maybe the sounds of nature, no clip art graphics, we have lots of photos to use. video clips and still images of trails and sites. mouse-over menus. Easy to use. Limited scrolling.
